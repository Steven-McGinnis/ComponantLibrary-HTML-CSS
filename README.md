# HTML and CSS Component Library ðŸŽ¨

This **HTML and CSS Component Library** is a collection of reusable, responsive, and accessible UI components created purely with HTML and CSS. These components were developed as part of my learning journey in Jonas Schmedtmann's course on modern web development. The library demonstrates how to design and build robust web components without relying on JavaScript or frameworks.
